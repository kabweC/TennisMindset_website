Tennis is a Percentage game.

Tennis is not about hitting the ball where I want to hit. Tennis is about hitting it where my opponent doesn't want it!

How do I get better?

"If you take it one day at a time and knock them off one by one, you get there a lot sooner than you anticipate.'' -Andre Agassi.

Disappointment vs Determination

Show determination, not disappointment, when you lose a point. Disappointment tells your opponent you are wounded and you may as well be leaving a trail of blood around the court from that wound.

Andre Tells Us What We Ultimately play for


"You have to put yourself in a position to give yourself the best shot, not even with any guarantees it is going well for you. You realize what all the hard work is about, and there is no feeling like it."

Always have a <strong>plan</strong>before you start a point.

The currency of Tennis is <strong>Hard Work.</strong>
